               <h1> This is Eiffel Tower in Paris</h1>

    There’s no mistaking it: the Eiffel Tower rips through the air like a giant. This impressive symbol of France 
    can be seen from almost anywhere in the city. Reigning 324 meters high, the iron tower has dominated the 
    Parisian horizon ever since the 1889 Universal Exhibition.

   Its construction -- completed in just 2 years, 2 months and 5 days -- was an incredibly technical and 
   architectural feat. Meant to stay standing for only 20 years, the Eiffel Tower was saved by its immense popularity
   and by Gustave Eiffel’s scientific experiments. In fact, its creator suggested a more functional purpose to the 
   tower: use it as an antenna for the first radiophonic transmissions. Although its existence was controversial from
   the beginning, the Eiffel Tower ended up conquering the hearts and minds of its most ardent critics. Today,
   the Eiffel Tower is home to numerous events that attract people from all around the world.
